CSE 803 Sign Language Project
Project Members: Matthew DiRisio, Abigail Murray

This project aims to bridge the communication divide between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, relying on American Sign Language (ASL) as their primary means of communication, and those who may not be familiar with sign language.
